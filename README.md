# 📌 Project: Telegram Intent Bot – AI-Powered Task & Idea Capture

## Description  
The Telegram Intent Bot is an AI-powered assistant built on **n8n** that captures your thoughts, tasks, and ideas the moment they appear — before distractions wipe them away.  
It listens to any message you send (no commands required), understands its type, and routes it automatically to the right destination — so nothing important gets lost.

## 🚀 Features

- **Instant Idea Capture**  
  Send any message to your Telegram bot — no formatting or commands needed.

- **AI-Powered Intent Detection**  
  Uses **Groq** or **OpenAI** to classify messages as:
  - Task
  - Idea
  - Note

- **Automated Routing**  
  - Sends tasks to **Notion**  
  - Stores ideas in **Airtable**  
  - Emails notes directly to your inbox with friendly, auto-written copy

- **Real-Time Processing**  
  Everything happens instantly — no manual sorting, no forgetting.
